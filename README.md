The repositary consists of projects that are implemented using python

In the attached, we have used tkinter and GTTs python modules for designing a gui and to convert the given text to speech respectively.
We have created a tkinter window with some labels, buttons and an entry. When we enter a string into the entry, the program outputs a ".wav" audio file
named "convert.wav" that contains the verbal output of the enterd string.
